# "Creating Mobile Apps Interactively" - \<Paulus Esterhazy\>

**Format**: "Live Demo and Presentation (40 minutes)"

**Topics**: React Native, Boot React Native, Reagent, ClojureScript

Creative work requires immediate feedback, especially when you're building UIs.
Boot React Native extends ClojureScript's reach, offering a way to build apps
for iOS and Android with a focus on short feedback cycles. In this demo, I'll
live-code a simple mobile game, starting from scratch. In the process, I'll
demonstrate how to set up Reagent for live reloading and how to style React Native components.
